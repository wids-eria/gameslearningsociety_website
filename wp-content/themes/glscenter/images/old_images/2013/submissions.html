		<h1>Session Formats</h1>
			<h2>Presentation (4-7 pages; blind peer-review)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Presentation.docx">TEMPLATE HERE</a> <p>An individual 15–20 minute presentation. We'll cluster three to four presentations into each session, and assign a session discussant to draw out common themes and to field audience questions. Standard format used by most conferences. Please let us know when you submit if you have any special needs for your presentation.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Symposium (4-7 pages; blind peer-review)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Symposium.docx">TEMPLATE HERE</a><p> Like a presentation session, but crafted by you to tackle a specific theme or issue related to conference themes. Format can vary from a cluster of three or more presentations with a designated discussant to a debate-style moderated panel—it all depends on how creative you want to be. Every symposium ends with audience Q&A, but we especially welcome symposia that promote plenty of engagement and interaction throughout.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Worked Example (4-7 pages; blind peer-review)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Worked%20Example.docx">TEMPLATE HERE</a><p> A worked example is an innovative format for field building collaboration and publication, based on work by James Paul Gee and Sasha Barab. Working examples involve proposing an exemplar for what one believes could be an important argument, method, model, or finding, doing so in a manner that reveals both the underlying idea and the conditions through which the idea takes on its meaning. The author or authors work through their reasoning, often using multimedia tools, to explicate an idea in public, lucid, and cross-disciplinary accessible terms. The point is to invite others to comment, add to one's example, or connect their own related examples so as to create an emerging network of examples that simultaneously evolve the ideas central to the particular example and that grow a networked community of ongoing collaboration. Rather than presenting a final closed argument or solved problem, a worked example functions as an "invitation" into conversation with other scholars, as well as for policy makers, funders, and educators in some cases. One can think of worked examples—or what we could also call "working examples"—as a "provocative object" for calibrating like minds.  Here’s a working example about working examples, and your submission should be in the seed or sprout stage of working examples like this one.</p>  
			<br>
			<h2>Workshop (4-7 pages)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Workshop.docx">TEMPLATE HERE</a><p> An interactive, hour-long (or longer) workshop in a single session, during which presenters engage the audience directly; they are highly participatory and include discussion and debriefing following the activity. If an hour is not enough time, tell us how much time you need.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Fireside Chat (4-7 pages)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Fireside%20Chat.docx">TEMPLATE HERE</a><p> A special hour-long session that fosters informal discussion among a smaller group on a specific topic of interest. Each chat is organized around a special guest (e.g., Gandhi) or theme (e.g., the low-down on "game addiction" theory and research). Think of these as an official (and cozy!) space for chatting with colleagues.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Well Played (4-7 pages; blind peer-review)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Well%20Played.docx">TEMPLATE HERE</a><p> These sessions will focus on the experience of playing specific videogames. Sequences from the games will be analyzed in detail in order to illustrate and interpret how the design of various components enable players to learn how to play through the game successfully, as well as how the design of the various elements combine together to create a fulfilling gameplay experience. Sessions will explore narrative development and game design, highlighting overarching themes and game play mechanics and providing a variety of perspectives on the value of games. These sessions are inspired by the ETC Press Well Played book series and Well Played journal that is based on this format of conversational scholarship. The goal of these sessions is to help further develop and define a literacy of games as well as a sense of their value. Videogames are a complex medium that merits careful interpretation and insightful analysis.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Poster Session (1-2 pages; blind peer-review)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Poster.doc">TEMPLATE HERE</a> <p>GLS 9.0 will again feature our Massively Multiplayer In-Person Poster Session (MMIPPS)—with a delicious dinner and open bar—ideal for those who wish to engage in informal, face-to-face discussions about their research with colleagues and other conference attendees. We encourage the submission of ongoing and in-progress research for the poster session.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Micropresentation (1-2 pages; blind peer-review)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Micropresentation.doc">TEMPLATE HERE</a><p> Originally inspired by the wildly successful "Pecha Kucha" format from Japan, micropresentations are short talks designed to allow more people to present on a select theme, while at the same time increasing the intensity and focus of the presentations themselves. Each speaker is allowed 20 slide images and given 20 seconds for each slide for a total of exactly 6 minutes and 40 seconds for their entire presentation. (Oh yes—we will time you that closely.) The result is a quick and concise look into the core claims of each speaker followed by summative observations from the discussant and direct conversation with the audience. This is a fun new format that packs an information-filled punch.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Hall of Failure (4-7 pages; blind peer-review)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Hall%20of%20Failure.docx">TEMPLATE HERE</a> <p>There is little incentive in academics and industry to share our failures, yet without such dialogue there is no way to learn from one another's mistakes. Again this year, we are hosting a special series of presentations dedicated to "interesting failures". Highly competitive, the Hall of Failure will feature ideas that should have worked but didn't, presented by the forward-thinking people who dared to try. Session discussion will interrogate why they didn't work and lessons learned.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Big Debates (4-7 pages; blind peer-review)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Big%20Debate.docx">TEMPLATE HERE</a><p> Our field is now at a point where key issues have emerged, bringing with them identifiable positions on those issues. We believe it's time to develop public, structured, moderated conversation on those key topics chosen by the community (e.g., transfer, embedded assessments). Participants will be asked to prepare position statements in advance. Debate events will be carefully moderated and interactive among participants with the goal of, if not necessarily settling the issue, then at least identifying its entailments and mapping its problem space.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Second Annual Educational Game Arcade (1-2 pages; blind peer-review)</h2> <a href="/2013/templates/GLS%20Submission%20Template%20-%20Educational%20Game%20Arcade.doc">TEMPLATE HERE</a> <p>This year we are premiering an educational game arcade to showcase educational games created by conference attendees. If your game is selected you will have the opportunity to share it in an arcade-style setting where the GLS community can play and talk with you about your game.  </p>
