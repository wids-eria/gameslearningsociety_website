				<p>The second annual Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for Ph.D. students working on topics related to Games+Learning+Society (GLS) to share and receive feedback from peers and mentors. Applicants should be advanced graduate students at the research or analysis phase of their dissertation; this will provide an opportunity for participation in the Consortium to influence their process.</p><br>

<p>The objectives of the Doctoral Consortium Workshop are:<br>
<ul>
<li>provide a setting for mutual feedback on participants' current research;</li>
<li>provide guidance on future research directions;</li>
<li>provide a forum for discussing methodological and theoretical issues important to GLS;</li>
<li>develop a supportive community of scholars in GLS;</li>
<li>develop a spirit of collaborative research across disciplines, countries, and institutions.</li>
</ul></p><br>

<p>Doctoral Consortium activities are designed for small group interactions. The Consortium will begin with the participants introducing themselves and presenting a short description of the aspect of their research they would like to discuss during the symposium.</p><br>

<p>Then, based on participants’ issues of interest (theoretical, research question, data collection, analyses, relevance to practice, design, writing, etc.), participants and mentors will break into small groups for intensive work time. Following small group interactions, participants will report their progress to the consortium. Plans for further joint activity will be discussed as well.</p><br>

<p>The Doctoral Consortium will precede the GLS 9.0 Conference, taking place all day June 11, 2013.  Additionally, there will be opportunities for collaboration between the GLS Doctoral Consortium and the Doctoral Consortium that is part of the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning conference, convening just after GLS.</p><br>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>February 15, 2013 – The submission system opens</p>
<p>March 15, 2013 - Submissions due by 11:59 PM (PST)</p>
<p>April 15, 2013 - Notification of acceptance by email to submitter</p><br>

<h2>Who Should Submit?</h2>
<p>The Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for advanced Ph.D. students in fields related to Games+Learning+Society to share their current research with their peers and a panel of faculty selected from across our field. Consortium participation is open only to Ph.D. candidates who are near dissertation stage or who have completed dissertation proposals. (Students from Europe and Asia should be in the equivalent stage of their doctoral work, e.g. have successfully transferred from M.Phil. to Ph.D. and/or are in the second year of a Ph.D. program). If you will be 'done' with your dissertation at or around the time of the Consortium, you should not apply.</p><br>

<p>The Review and Selection Committee will strive to identify a diverse group of high quality students to participate in the Doctoral Consortium. To encourage active participation and informal interactions as well as in-depth discussions, the total number of participants will be kept relatively small (10 or fewer).</p><br>

<h2>Application Process</h2>
<p>To apply, please submit the following online at <a href="https://precisionconference.com/~gls">https://precisionconference.com/~gls</a></p><br>
<ul>
<li>A cover sheet with your name, title of your research project/dissertation, your advisor's name, your institution, your e-mail address, your phone and fax numbers, and your surface mail address.</li><br>
<li>A 2500-word summary (not including references) of your research; please use the <a href="./templates/Doctoral Consortium Template.doc">provided template</a>. Include in this summary the goals of the research, background of the project, the methodology, current status, preliminary results or results of pilot work. The last part of the summary should include the particular issue you want to be the focus of the presentation and discussion at the Consortium (e.g., analyses, data collection, writing). This document will be first used to select Consortium participants and then circulated to other participants to summarize your work and prepare you for the actual presentation, workshops, and discussion. In this way, your initial presentation does not have to provide the summary and can focus specifically on the issues of interest.</li><br>
<li>A letter of recommendation from your dissertation advisor. This must include an assessment of the current status of your work, and an expected date for the completion of the dissertation.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>These materials should be in one file (Word .doc). All questions should be directed to the Committee Chair, Dr. Erica Halverson, erhalverson@education.wisc.edu.</p><br>
