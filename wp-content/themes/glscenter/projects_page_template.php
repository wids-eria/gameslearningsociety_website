				The world is overrun with zombies. You, as a member
				of The Progenitor X Defense Force are a part of a
				highly trained squad of scientists who can save us.
				Using highly advanced bio-medical technology, you
				locate, seek out, and treat infected humans to contain
				the threat. With your help, the Progenitor X Defense
				Force will prevail. But be aware: Zombies are out there,
				and we are all susceptible.

				Learning in the Making is a collaborative research project between University of
				Wisconsin-Madison, George Mason University, 
				and the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh. This research project takes an ethnographic and 
				design-based approach in order to 
				understand how and what people learn from their participation in makerspaces, and also to 
				explore how features of these 
				environments can be leveraged to create designed learning experiences. The goal of this 
				project is to leverage the strengths 
				of the makerspaces themselves in order to enhance what is known about effective studio 
				teaching and learning, and to understand 
				how to support youth to become competent, creative, and reflective producers with 
				technologies.

				CyberSTEM is a an National Science Foundation funded game-based learning network designed to engage K–12 and adult learners, teachers, administrators, informal science educators, and research scientists. The project will link GLS games—such as Progenitor X, FairPlay, Tenacity, Virulent and Citizen Science—to a cyberlearning network designed to establish a new model of science education that spans home and school, brings youth and adults together in learning, and integrates cutting-edge analytic, visualization and networking to  transform science education.
